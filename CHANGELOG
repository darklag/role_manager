v1.0.5
-- Found that some dblink functions must be owned by a superuser to work properly (dblink_connect_u). Made it so ownership of any functions in dblink will never have ownership changed.


v1.0.4
-- Handle changing view ownership
-- Handle changing aggregate ownership


v1.0.3
-- Exclude pg_toast table from privilege/ownership chanages.


v1.0.2
-- set_app_privileges() now sets the default access privileges for the appname_owner role. This allows all objects created by the owner role to automatically set the default permissions for the appname_app and appname_readonly roles.


v1.0.1
-- Fix syntax errors in ownership assignment in set_app_privileges().
-- Ensure all object names used in generated queries are properly quoted in set_app_privileges().
